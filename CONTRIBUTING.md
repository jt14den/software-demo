# CONTRIBUTING

## Welcome!

## Ways to Contribute

Since this is a very small project there are just a few kinds of contributions we anticipate:

- Bug fixes (spelling corrections, broken link fixes, etc.)
- New content (additions to the analysis)

## Pull Request Lifecycle

1. **Fork and Clone** the repo.
2. Create a branch from \`main\`.
3. Submit your pull request when you have a working implementation.
